191044307,What animal is black?,"  This is a more complex question that requires the use of multiple methods in the `ImagePatch` class. Here's one possible way to answer the question:
```
def execute_command(image):
    image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
    animal_patches = image_patch.find(""animal"")
    for animal_patch in animal_patches:
        if animal_patch.verify_property(""animal"", ""black""):
            return animal_patch.simple_query(""What animal is black?"")
    return image_patch.simple_query(""What animal is black?"")
```
This code first finds all the animal patches in the image using the `find` method. Then, it iterates over each animal patch and checks if it has the property ""black"" using the `verify_property` method. If an animal patch has the property ""black"", it returns the answer to the question ""What animal is black?"" using the `simple_query` method. If no animal patch has the property ""black"", it returns the answer to the question ""What animal is black?"" using the `simple_query` method."
