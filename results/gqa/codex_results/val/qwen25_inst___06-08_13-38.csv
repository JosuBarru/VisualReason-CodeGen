13151559,Is the large hair both white and soft?,"To determine if the large hair is both white and soft, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the large hair in the image.
2. Verify if the hair is white.
3. Verify if the hair is soft.

Here's how you can implement this:

```python
def execute_command(image):
    image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
    hair_patches = image_patch.find(""hair"")
    # Question assumes only one large hair patch
    if len(hair_patches) == 0:
        # If no hair is found, query the image directly
        return image_patch.simple_query(""Is the large hair both white and soft?"")
    
    large_hair_patch = None
    for hair_patch in hair_patches:
        if hair_patch.area > image_patch.width * image_patch.height / 10:  # Assuming large hair is more than 1/10th of the image area
            large_hair_patch = hair_patch
            break
    
    if large_hair_patch is None:
        return ""no""  # No large hair found
    
    is_white = large_hair_patch.verify_property(""hair"", ""white"")
    is_soft = large_hair_patch.verify_property(""hair"", ""soft"")
    
    return bool_to_yesno(is_white and is_soft)
```

In this implementation:
- We first find all hair patches in the image.
- We then identify the largest hair patch as the ""large hair"".
- We check if the large hair is white and soft using the `verify_property` method.
- Finally, we return ""yes"" if both properties are true, otherwise ""no""."
