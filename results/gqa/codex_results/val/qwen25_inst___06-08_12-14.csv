17736165,Do the dishwasher to the left of the woman and the gas stove inside the kitchen both have white color?,"To determine if the dishwasher to the left of the woman and the gas stove inside the kitchen both have white color, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the woman in the image.
2. Find the dishwasher to the left of the woman.
3. Find the gas stove in the kitchen.
4. Verify if the dishwasher and the gas stove have a white color.

Here is the code to achieve this:

```python
def execute_command(image)->str:
    image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
    
    # Find the woman
    woman_patches = image_patch.find(""woman"")
    if len(woman_patches) == 0:
        return image_patch.simple_query(""Is there a woman in the image?"")

    # Find the dishwasher to the left of the woman
    dishwasher_patches = image_patch.find(""dishwasher"")
    if len(dishwasher_patches) == 0:
        return image_patch.simple_query(""Is there a dishwasher to the left of the woman?"")
    
    for dishwasher_patch in dishwasher_patches:
        if dishwasher_patch.horizontal_center < woman_patch.horizontal_center:

    # Check if both the dishwasher and the gas stove are white
    return bool_to_yesno(dishwasher_is_white and gas_stove_is_white)
```

This function will first find the woman and the dishwasher to the left of her. Then it will find the gas stove in the kitchen. Finally, it will check if both the dishwasher and the gas stove have a white color and return the result."

1. Find the baby.
2. Determine the color of the bed sheet the baby is on.
3. Find the piece of furniture.
