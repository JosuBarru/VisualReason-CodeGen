        An array-like of the cropped image taken from the original image.
    left : int
        An int describing the position of the left border of the crop's bounding box in the original image.
    lower : int
        An int describing the position of the bottom border of the crop's bounding box in the original image.

    Attributes
    ----------
    cropped_image : array_like
        An array-like of the cropped image taken from the original image.
    left : int
        An int describing the position of the left border of the crop's bounding box in the original image.
    lower : int
        An int describing the position of the bottom border of the crop's bounding box in the original image.

        An array-like of the cropped image taken from the original image.
    left : int
        An int describing the position of the left border of the crop's bounding box in the original image.
    lower : int
        An int describing the position of the bottom border of the crop's bounding box in the original image.
