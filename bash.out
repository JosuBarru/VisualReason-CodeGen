    Attributes
    ----------
    cropped_image : array_like
        An array-like of the cropped image taken from the original image.
    left : int
        An int describing the position of the left border of the crop's bounding box in the original image.
    lower : int
        An int describing the position of the bottom border of the crop's bounding box in the original image.
    right : int
        An int describing the position of the right border of the crop's bounding box in the original image.

    Methods
    -------

        Returns a list of new ImagePatch objects containing crops of the image centered around any objects found in the image matching the object_name.
    simple_query(question: str=None)->str
        Returns the answer to a basic question asked about the image. If no question is provided, returns the answer to "What is this?".
    exists(object_name: str)->bool
        Returns True if the object specified by object_name is found in the image, and False otherwise.
    verify_property(property: str)->bool
        Returns True if the property is met, and False otherwise.
    best_text_match(string1: str, string2: str)->str
        Returns the string that best matches the image.
